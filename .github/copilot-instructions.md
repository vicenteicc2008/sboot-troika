LK is an open source kernel intended to primarily run in supervisor mode on a variety
of 32bit and 64bit architectures.

It is designed to be small, fast, and efficient, with a focus on real-time performance.
It is primarily written in C and assembly, with some parts in C++. The C++ parts mostly
do not use the standard C++ library, and no exceptions.

It is used in a variety of embedded and real-time systems, including automotive, industrial,
and consumer electronics. It is also used in some academic and research projects.
